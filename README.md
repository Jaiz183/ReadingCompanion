# ReadingCompanion
iOS app that acts as a companion when reading books. Looks up information about a book from a picture of its cover, identifies difficult vocabulary on the page of a book and annotates the page of a book with definitions of difficult vocabulary.

## Current Status
1. Identifies text and draws bounding boxes, but accuracy is yet to be improved and selective bounding boxes around only difficult words are yet to be implemented.
2. Identifies difficult words, but level of difficulty is arbitrary and data set must be customized.
3. Manually searches for books, but only by ISBN and without OCR.
